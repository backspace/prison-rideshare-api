Hey, <%= @person.name %>!

Here is your unique calendar link for <%= @month %>: <%= @link %>

You can use this to share availability in advance with the coordinator, they will ask you first if a ride request comes for a slot you’ve chosen.

There’s a bug fix this month: the slot no longer disappears when you commit to it, which inadvertently prevented canceling a commitment. Remember that we can’t fix bugs without knowing what they are, so thanks to the user who reported this!
