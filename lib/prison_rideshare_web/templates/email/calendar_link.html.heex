<p>Hey, <%= @person.name %>!</p>

<p><a href={@link}>Here</a> is your unique calendar link for <%= @month %>.</p>

<p>You can use this to share availability in advance with the coordinator, they will ask you first if a ride request comes for a slot you’ve chosen.</p>

<p>There’s a bug fix this month: the slot no longer disappears when you commit to it, which inadvertently prevented canceling a commitment. Remember that we can’t fix bugs without knowing what they are, so thanks to the driver who reported this!</p>

<p>Thanks for volunteering 💞 #FreeThemAll</p>
